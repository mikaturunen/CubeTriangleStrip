Simple Algorithm to turn a N sized cube into a Triangle strip for easier rendering.
I have used GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP (OpenGL) to render it.

Triangle strip --> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_strip

There are quite many algorithms going on around the internet but I personally did not find any
implementation examples, so I thought I'd write one myself for everyone to look at, I followed
this paper for the implementation: http://www.cs.umd.edu/gvil/papers/av_ts.pdf

The vertices can be acquired either in clockwise order or anti-clockwise order. OpenGL by
default uses anti-clockwise ordering. 

Note that the header also contains a dummy struct V3 (Vector3) just to make the internals
of Utilities::Cube::CreateTriangleStrip() more readable.
